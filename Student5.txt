Student5, you performed amazing this semester in Biology. You met most, if not all the criteria in the class which resulted in your final grade of a A. You did an expectional job on the learning indictor for team work. Student5, I hope you keep up with the good work in the future. You are interacting with the material incredibly well! You, Student5, have exceeded my expectations. You earned test scores this semester of 94, 79, 82, 90. You had a highest test score of 94 and an average test score of 86.25. Your highest test score shows you have an amazing understanding of what is being taught in class. Your writing style is forming! However, your lack of attention to slight grammar errors and other such issues are affecting your work. However, with more time, you can improve your writing even more.

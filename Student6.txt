Student6, you performed amazing this semester in Biology. You met most, if not all the criteria in the class which resulted in your final grade of a B. You approcahed the learning indictor on team work. Student6, although you were sometimes on task you struggled to show your ability to work efficiently with a team You are interacting with the material incredibly well! You, Student6, have exceeded my expectations. You earned test scores this semester of 80, 91, 71, 90. You had a highest test score of 91 and an average test score of 83.0. Your highest test score shows you have an amazing understanding of what is being taught in class. Your writing style is forming! However, your lack of attention to slight grammar errors and other such issues are affecting your work. However, with more time, you can improve your writing even more.

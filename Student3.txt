Student3, you performed amazing this semester in Pre-Calc. You met most, if not all the criteria in the class which resulted in your final grade of a B+. You did a great job when it came to the learning indicator on team work. Student3, overall I was very impressed with your team work this semester You are interacting with the material well! I believe you, Student3, can improve even more so. Keep up the good work. You earned test scores this semester of 82, 73, 99, 70. You had a highest test score of 99 and an average test score of 81.0. Your highest test score shows you have an amazing understanding of what is being taught in class. Your writing style is forming! However, your lack of attention to slight grammar errors and other such issues are affecting your work. However, with more time, you can improve your writing even more.
